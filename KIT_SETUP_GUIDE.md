# Kit Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the Kit (formerly ConvertKit) integration for CompeteAI's waitlist signup feature.

## Overview

The waitlist signup form on the homepage integrates with Kit to automatically add subscribers to a specific form (ID: 8209587). This approach handles the entire opt-in flow automatically, including confirmation emails.

## Prerequisites

1. **Kit Account**: You need an active Kit account
2. **API Key**: Your Kit API key (already configured)
3. **Form**: A Kit form created in your dashboard (Form ID: 8209587)

## Current Setup

### Environment Configuration

The Kit API key is stored in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_KIT_API_KEY=kit_24029566702d4cfa95fbfc2c766f41d6
```

### API Integration

The integration uses Kit's v4 API with the following endpoint:
```
POST https://api.kit.com/v4/forms/{form_id}/subscribers
```

### Form Configuration

**Form ID**: 8209587

This form should be configured in your Kit dashboard with:
- **Confirmation Email**: Set up to send automatically when someone subscribes
- **Welcome Email**: Optional welcome message after confirmation
- **Form Settings**: Configure double opt-in if desired

## How It Works

1. **User Submission**: User enters email on homepage waitlist form
2. **API Call**: Email is sent to Kit via the form endpoint
3. **Form Processing**: Kit processes the subscription according to your form settings
4. **Confirmation Flow**: Kit handles the confirmation email automatically
5. **List Management**: Confirmed subscribers are added to your main list

## Benefits of Form-Based Approach

- **Automatic Confirmation**: Kit handles the entire opt-in flow
- **Customizable Emails**: Configure confirmation and welcome emails in Kit dashboard
- **Better Tracking**: Form-specific analytics and reporting
- **Compliance**: Built-in GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliance
- **Segmentation**: Easy to segment subscribers by form source

## Kit Dashboard Configuration

### 1. Form Settings
- Go to **Forms** in your Kit dashboard
- Find form ID 8209587
- Configure confirmation email template
- Set up welcome sequence if desired

### 2. Email Templates
- **Confirmation Email**: Customize the double opt-in email
- **Welcome Email**: Set up initial welcome message
- **Thank You Page**: Configure post-signup experience

### 3. Automation (Optional)
You can create automations triggered by this form:
- Welcome email sequence
- Onboarding series
- Product updates
- Launch notifications

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Kit Dashboard
- **Form Analytics**: View signup rates and conversion
- **Subscriber Growth**: Track waitlist growth over time
- **Email Performance**: Monitor confirmation and welcome email stats

### Application Logs
The integration logs successful subscriptions and errors to the browser console for debugging.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify the API key is correct in `.env`
   - Ensure the key has proper permissions

2. **Form Not Found**
   - Verify form ID 8209587 exists in your Kit account
   - Check that the form is active

3. **Email Not Received**
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify confirmation email is configured in Kit
   - Test with different email providers

### Error Handling

The application handles these scenarios:
- **Duplicate Email**: Shows "already subscribed" message
- **Invalid Email**: Validates email format
- **API Errors**: Shows user-friendly error messages
- **Network Issues**: Handles connection problems gracefully

## Testing

### Test the Integration
1. Use a test email address
2. Submit through the homepage form
3. Check Kit dashboard for new subscriber
4. Verify confirmation email is sent
5. Test the confirmation flow

### Test Scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Custom Fields**: Add name, company, or other fields
2. **UTM Tracking**: Enhanced referrer tracking
3. **A/B Testing**: Test different form configurations
4. **Segmentation**: Automatic tagging based on source
5. **Progressive Profiling**: Collect additional data over time
